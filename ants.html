                <h3>Argentine Ant</h3>
                <p>This small non-stinging ant is about 1/8th inch and is a brownish color. They are the most persistent and troublesome ant that invades houses because they are small and can get through tiny cracks. Argentine Ants live in shallow galleries in the ground often only a few inches deep. A single colony has multiple queens and can grow quite rapidly, displacing other native types of ants. They also rapidly establish other colonies when a queen leaves and takes some of the workers with her. These satellite colonies may eventually return, or they may become the mother colony to many new colonies. During the hot summer months, some may even be temporarily established inside homes under carpets, attic insulation, in walls and potted plants</p>

                <h3>Carpenter Ant</h3>
                <p>Carpenter ants are one of the larger ants that invade homes and are usually ¼ to ½ inch in size. Despite what their name may imply, they do not actually eat wood. These non-stinging ants tunnel through wood to create their homes and can do considerable damage. They will infest dead trees, telephone poles, and houses but can also be found in lawns. They feed on other insects and juices and are fond of anything sweet. They are liquid feeders and unable to swallow solid foods. Adult carpenter ants have the ability to bite. Each colony has one queen, who lays only a few eggs that become minor workers, who then go out and forage to feed the queen and the young. A colony may eventually contain over 3,000 workers. When they get into houses, damage can be severe and require extensive repairs.</p>

                <h3>Harvester Ant</h3>
                <p>The California variety of the harvester ant is 1/4th inch in size and red colored. Nests are found underground with a small mound at the opening, which is littered with leftover food debris. They generally seek seeds as a main source of food. During the winter, the nest is sealed off and no activity is seen. The harvester ant is known for its ability to sting. These ants have been able to kill small pigs by their sudden and vicious attacks. Harvester Ants will go after people and any small animal that gets too close to their nest. A few types will leave the stinger in their victim just as bees do</p>

                <h3>Little Black Ant</h3>
                <p>This very small stinging ant is about 1/16th inch and colored dark brown to black. They build nests underground, under tree bark, beneath rocks, and can even infest woodwork in buildings. They will nest both indoors and outdoors. They will also build nests in lawns and vacant lots. Their favorite food is insect honeydew, but in houses they will go after just about anything such as grease, sweets, meat, fruits, and vegetables. They even eat other insects, both dead and alive.</p>

                <h3>Odorous House Ant</h3>
                <p>This small non-stinging ant is about 1/8th inch and colored dark brown to black. They get their name from the rotten coconut-like odor that they produce when they are crushed. They routinely invade houses searching for food during the winter, when their usual honeydew food outside is gone. Like the Argentine ant, colonies contain multiple queens and a few thousand worker ants. They nest under stones and pavement and will establish nest inside houses also.</p>

                <h3>Pharaoh Ant</h3>
                <p>Pharaoh ants are small, less than 1/16th inch, and are a yellowish to brownish color. This stinging ant will eat just about anything that people eat especially fatty and greasy foods like meat and sweets. As a predator to many insects it can spread bacteria. Their unusual name comes from its original habitat in Egypt. The Pharaoh ant seeks to establish nests in warm and inaccessible locations inside buildings near food. A colony contains many queens and can have hundreds of thousands of workers!</p>

                <h3>Southern Fire Ant</h3>
                <p>The Southern fire ant is widespread throughout the lower altitudes of Southern California. The Southern fire ant is generally a little smaller than the red imported fire ant, but can also cause significant damage and inflict a painful sting. They are up to 1/4th inch long, and have a reddish brown or black color. Their nests are sensitive to vibrations so if a footstep is detected close by, the ants will swarm out to attack. They build mounds, with the nests located under objects like stones, boards, or anything on the ground that provides cover. They will also get into the wood or masonry of a house, and can build mounds. The Southern fire ant can also be a problem to crops. It will eat just about anything and are known to kill young or newborn birds and poultry. It’s been reported that they have eaten the rubber insulation off electrical wiring, causing shorts in wiring.</p>
